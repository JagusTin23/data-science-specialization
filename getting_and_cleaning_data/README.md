### Instruction to viewing the SamsungMeanData.txt data

The script run_analysis.R includes comments with a detailed description of each step taken to create the data set. The script includes code that will download the data to your current working directory. The script will unzip the data and will read the data from your current working directory. 

The last two lines of the script will read the SamsungMeanData.txt file and will output the first six lines of the data set to the R console.  If you wish to read the data without running the script please use the read.table() function and include header = TRUE argument. Otherwise the data will not be displayed correctly.
